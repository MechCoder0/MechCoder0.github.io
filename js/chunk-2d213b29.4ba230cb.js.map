And food in general. I love food. A lot. From apple pie, to strawberry pie, to peach pie, food in all forms is great. My Mennonite mother raised me on amazing food. If there is one thing to know about Mennonites, it is their food is five things: easy to make, made with three ingredients, is tasty, is cheap, and has a very descriptive name. For example, the ham and green bean casserole has ham and green beans, the beef and potato casserole has beef and potatoes, the Sunday casserole is made and eaten on Sunday, the tortilla casserole has tortillas, and the chicken over noodles is a meal where one puts chicken, you guessed it, over noodles. \")]),_c('p',[_vm._v(\" The problem growing up with homemade, made from scratch, scrumptious delectable delights every day of one’s life, is one grows accustomed to a certain level of quality in their food.
