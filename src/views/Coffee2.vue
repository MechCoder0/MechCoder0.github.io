				<h1> Coffee Time! Version 2</h1>
				<div>
					<p>
						This is yet another story about coffee. Coffee is a common theme in my life. 
                        It is beautiful, life-giving, and warm. I look forward to it's warm embrace every morning. 
                        I have many mugs, but there are few which are my favorites: one from a software job, one stolen from my parents. 
                        The one from software is medium size, a texture which is a mix between sand and glass, and has some solid heft. 
                        The one taken from my birthing-person and non-birthing-person I love for one reason: it says coffee, coffee, coffee, coffeeâ€¦

                        One day my wife and I were looking to make some ichor of the gods and noticed things had changed: 
                        our coffee maker was making weird sounds! This would not do! We had to fix this! This was our highest priority! 
                        Several months later we started to investigate. It sounded like there was a hole in the pipe which takes the water 
                        from the bottom to the top. I looked and looked and looked and couldn't find a hole. 
                        What did I find? Our detachable light which had dropped into the tank. 
					</p>

                        With the light removed, we expected our machine to machine better. 
                        However, we were sorely disappointed. Our machine sounded exactly the same. 
                        To this day, the machine remains one of strange noises.
