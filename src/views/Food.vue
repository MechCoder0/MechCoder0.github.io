        <h1>Food Time!</h1>

                This story is about casseroles. And food in general. 
                I love food. A lot. From apple pie, to strawberry pie, 
                to peach pie, food in all forms is great. 
                My Mennonite mother raised me on amazing food. 
                If there is one thing to know about Mennonites, 
                it is their food is five things: easy to make, 
                made with three ingredients, is tasty, is cheap, and has a very 
                descriptive name. For example, the ham and green bean casserole 
                has ham and green beans, the beef and potato casserole 
                has beef and potatoes, the Sunday casserole is made and 
                eaten on Sunday, the tortilla casserole has tortillas, and the 
                chicken over noodles is a meal where one puts chicken, 
                you guessed it, over noodles.

                The problem growing up with homemade, made from scratch, 
                scrumptious delectable delights every day of one’s life, is one grows accustomed to a certain level of quality in their food. 
                This problem only realizes itself when one moves away. This was the case when I moved to college.

                Year one of college was fine on the food front. I did not make my own food, 
                I just got it from the cafeteria. It was not anything special, except during valentine's day when 
                they attempted to serve $50 lobster and filet mignon, out of a college cafeteria. But all in all, the food was serviceable, 
                even tasty! For a college cafeteria. 
                No, the issue only became apparent when I made the bright decision to move off campus, into a shoebox with no counterspace, and make my own food.

                It started out fine. I knew how to make pizza, I knew how to make rice, I knew how to make pizza on a tortilla, 
                I knew how to make rice… But my expertise may have ended there. Did I mention I was fairly poor? Because I was. 
                This meant eating out was not really an option. You may wonder why I did not eat ramen! 
                This simple answer is I did not really understand how easy it was to make and how edible it was! 
                I grew up believing ramen should be eaten under no circumstances because of the amount of salt and other nonsense they threw into it. 
            </p>

                What did I do? I lost weight. Turns out the rice and pizza diet is 
                fairly effective at keeping BMI low! My other go to was finding free food. Free pizza on campus? I am there. 
                Spending every Sunday lunch at a friend’s house? 
                Consider me adopted. The Monday night Bible study provides supper? My stomach and I are in the Lord’s house. I got by. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Eventually I had more time and more money. Back to higher quality food I went! 
                But until that was the case, rice and oregano were my friends.
