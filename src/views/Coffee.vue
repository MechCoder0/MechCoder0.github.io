		<h1> Coffee Time!</h1>
		<div>
			<p>
				It is no secret I love coffee. I drink roughly my weight in caffeine every morning. 
				This leads to no problems and is great for my health. 
				Every morning is pretty much the same: I wake up, regret existence, eventually get up, 
				brush my teeth, use the toilet, eat an apple, and make mugs of coffee. 
				This routine I have has been pretty much the same for some time. When I got married, 
				the only thing that changed was the amount of coffee I had to share.  
			</p>
			<p>
				Being married, one cannot drink the highest tier of coffee every day, 
				because that causes poordom. I do not wish to be poor, so I devised a tier system for our coffee. 
				We drink mostly tier 2-3 coffee, and have tier 1 coffee on hand. 
				We usually end up drinking the tier 1 coffee because it's 
				getting too old though. We don't mind. 
				Here is a rundown of our tier lists of coffee. 
			</p>
			<h2>Tier 1</h2>
			<p class="indent">
				The God level. Coffee so good, you would not mind serving it to Jesus Himself, should he decide to visit some morning. 
				Here is where the whole bean, single origin, blessing from heaven exists. 
				This coffee usually runs about $15-20 /12 oz. That's right, it is so good you ca not even buy it 
				by the pound. That's how you know.
			</p>
			<h2>Tier 2</h2>
			<p class="indent">
				The middle-class level. Decent coffee.  
				Nothing to write home about. For example, I would not write, 
				"Dear mom, today I had a middle-class cup of coffee! It was completely adequate and exactly what I expected. 
				I brewed this mediocrity with my mediocre drip machine. Please send money."
				But that is not to say this coffee is bad! It just is decent. 
			</p>
			<h2>Tier 3</h2>
			<p class="indent">
				The “it's not bad, I enjoy it because it cost me less than dirt” level. 
				This level of coffee is usually bought by the case. 
				For roughly $1. But it is still serviceable! 
				This coffee should not be drunken with the expectancy of life change, 
				but it should still get the job done when you unexpectantly have your entire 20-person family visiting and they all want the Joe. 
			</p>
			<h2>Tier 4</h2>
			<p class="indent">
				The “I do not drink this unless I must" level. 
				This coffee is from church foyers and wedding receptions. 
				Notable mentions here are Folgers and Maxwell house. 
				Something that should be known, is these gallons of dirt 
				are not even 100% coffee! They only have to be roughly 60% coffee or some such legally. 
				Think twice before drinking. You have been warned.
			</p>
			<h2>Tier 5</h2>
			<p class="indent">
				The “Please don't make me” level. 
				This coffee is mostly reserved for instant coffee. 
				I believe this coffee was not ever meant to be consumed but 
				instead was a joke a sales team got a hold of. 
				This is the coffee the devil himself orders when he goes out. 
				Best not to be seen with it.
			</p>
			<p>
				These are our coffee levels! 
				I hope you have gained insight into the wonderful leveling of the dark brew. 
				May your day be blessed from the reading.
