			<h2>The Start</h2>
			<p class="indent">
				Ned was bred. 
				Once upon a time there was a boy. He was young. A boy was young? Asounding! 
				His name was Ned. Ned had a head. In Ned's head lived an idea. This idea, this Idea,
				this IDEA! THIS IKEA! Was to build an app which would led Ned said the idea in his head. 
				Ned started his app. He wrote and wrote and eventually his app was done. 
			</p>
			<h2>The Middle</h2>
			<p class="indent">
				Ned was read. 
				2 Billion drug users have become attached, addicted to joining 
				Ned in his quest to tell their stories. Ned never feared, for he wasn't worried about other people,
				he cared just for his own stories. Let them come, and pretend to voice oppinions. Don't they all know,
				the voice of Ned is the only one which matters? I will write all of my most controversial opinions and no 
				one will ever hold me accountable because I am the Creator.
			</p>
			<h2>The Middle - part 2</h2>
			<p class="indent">
				Ned did dread.
				His plan has backfired! Was he outrageously wealthy? Yes. Did everyone hang on every word he said?
				Indubitably. Was he happy? NO! The things he said were having an effect on his life! When he said 
				something as harmless as the poor should eat cake if they were hungry, his stock went down! And when he 
				said rich people were the most important, people got angry! This wouldn't do.   
			</p>
			<h2>The End</h2>
			<p class="indent">
				Ned was dead.
				Ned was dead. His life was over. Squashed under the weight of his own words. HA! Not really. 
				He died of cancer. But only after censoring all who disaggreed with him and paying off 
				all politions who would take a bribe, and threatening those who wouldn't. After all, how could 
				he be happy if his dream of changing the world didn't come into existance? He was the creator after all.
				Or was.
