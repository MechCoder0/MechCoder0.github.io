			<h1>The Introduction</h1>
			<p>
				Written, longform comedy. Who really has time for it? Among the call of the cellphone, TV, adds for Chinese food,
				and the ever present meme (pronounced mem), however, there is a call for entertainment which promps thought; entertainment
				which doesn't leave one feeling empty after it's gone. This web site has heard that call and reponded. Poorly.

				You want something more? Something funny, which actually has you laughing instead of blowing air out your
				nose just a little faster? Something which causes you to stare in shock at the words which are being read, 
				yet also somehow, causes you to think about the intricate, nuanced, philisophical delemias being handled with 
				charm and grace? You won't find that here! Go home. Oh... You're already at home, on your toilet, reading this
				on a computer unimaginably powerful? Might as well continue then. The links up top will guide your path.
