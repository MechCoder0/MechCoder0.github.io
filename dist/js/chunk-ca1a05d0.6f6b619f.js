If there is one thing to know about Mennonites, it is their food is five things: easy to make, made with three ingredients, is tasty, is cheap, and has a very descriptive name. For example, the ham and green bean casserole has ham and green beans, the beef and potato casserole has beef and potatoes, the Sunday casserole is made and eaten on Sunday, the tortilla casserole has tortillas, and the chicken over noodles is a meal where one puts chicken, you guessed it, over noodles.
