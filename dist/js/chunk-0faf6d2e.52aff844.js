Architecture by Smith and Sons, was their name. Their slogan? “We'll erect it quick!” I thought they should fire their marketing team, but it turns out, the CEO was the one who came up with the slogan, and he was rather fond of it. ASS consisted of gray walls, gray desks, gray people. When I started working there, I had a large desk with lots of space. Seated next to me was a women named Barbra. Barbra was an interesting one. She occasionally liked to talk, occasionally did not. It was always hard to tell what mood she was in. One day I came into the company and found my desk partner had moved. She had not moved companies, just desks.

What is the worst that could happen? A few old people who cannot outrun slow shambling kind of dead things die off? Good!
